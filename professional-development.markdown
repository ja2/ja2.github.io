# Professional Development

I am a tech lead at one of the world’s largest online sports betting companies.

To see a run down of my experience and work placements,  check out my linkedin profile.

A technical architect, lead, and developer with some 18 years experience, I’m passionate about producing scalable, supportable, reusable, robust software, both at the level of overall system design and directly within the code base.

I perform, and enjoy, fulfilling roles producing solutions, mentoring developers, or cranking out high quality code. I always look for opportunities to work with other senior technical staff to improve processes and practices to maximise quality and output across the whole development team.

In recent years my biggest successes have been in building large scale systems, not just in the traditional terms of production scale, but also during release and development, making it possible for large numbers of developers to work on many projects in the same code-base without conflict, and to be able to release those many projects at a very high cadence.

I am available for small ad-hoc freelance and consultancy work, where I am able to use my experience and expertise to input into and troubleshoot development projects or production systems. If you are interested in engaging me, then either send me an in-mail on linked in, or email at jon {at} ja2.co.uk

My technology stack expertise includes:

- Server-side development in Go, .Net and nodejs.
- Front-end development in Typescript, Javascript, CSS.
- HTTP technologies such as Caching, Request/Response Headers, Pre-loading, Push over Web-sockets.
- Databases in SQL and No-SQL, including working within large scale deployments.
- Android App development using React Native.
- Logging and Metrics in Splunk and Elk.
