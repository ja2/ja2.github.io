Software
With live products Fotum and Splat-O-Matic released, and more coming soon, I am aiming to build a varied portfolio of offerings across apps, web and desktop platforms.

## Fotum

Written for the Roku smart TV platform, and inspired by the demise of the Rokagram photo screensaver app, Fotum brings digital photo collections to life on the small screen. Fotum’s product page is [here](http://ja2.co.uk/software/fotum/).

## Splat-O-Matic App Family

The Splat-O-Matic family is a fun, up-to-date take on the concept of Whac-A-Mole arcade style game. The game engine is designed to support development of themed variants, aimed at topical public figures or entities. Splat-O-Matic’s product page is [here](http://ja2.co.uk/software/fotum/).
