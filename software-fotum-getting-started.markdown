# Fotum – Getting started

Here is a short guide to get you started with Fotum.

The Fotum Roku app will display photos from the cloud, or from a USB drive if your device supports it.

## To get Fotum on your Roku device:

- Search for Fotum in the [Roku Channel Store](https://channelstore.roku.com/details/109033/fotum), or find it in the list of screensaver apps on your device.
- Install the Fotum app onto your device.
- With your Roku device connected to your TV and switched on, select Settings in the main menu. Then select Themes, followed by  Screensaver.
- Select Fotum from the list of screensaver to enable it.
- To customize Fotum, select Custom settings.
- To try Fotum out you can preview the screensaver.

## To setup a cloud provider on your Roku device:

- You can now view a video walk-through showing authentication with Google Photos on Youtube here. Dropbox is very similar – the video should help there too.
- Visit the Fotum Auth service at https://fotum-auth.ja2.co.uk on your smartphone or PC.
- Select the cloud provider you wish to connect to.
- For precise details about what access is being requested, and how your data is handled, see the explanation on the Fotum – Privacy page.
- You may see an “are you sure?” type page to agree to before you proceed to login.
- Follow the steps to grant access for Fotum.
- Once complete you will receive a 9 digit one-time-code. The code expires after 5 minutes, and will only work once.
- Enter the code into the Cloud code settings screen in the Fotum screensaver settings area on your Roku device.

## To setup your USB drive for Roku:

- Plug the drive into your computer
- Create a new folder on the top level of the drive and name it Fotum
- Copy your photos into the new Fotum folder.
- Remove the USB drive from your computer
- Plug the drive into the USB port on your Roku device.
