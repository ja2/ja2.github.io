#  Fotum

Introducing Fotum, a screensaver for Roku smart TV devices that brings your photos to the small screen.

You can find Fotum in the [Roku Channel Store](https://channelstore.roku.com/details/109033/fotumhttps://channelstore.roku.com/details/109033/fotum).

Fotum will show images from:

- Google Photos New!
