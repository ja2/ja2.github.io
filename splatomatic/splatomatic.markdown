# Splat-O-Matic App Family

Splat-O-Matic is family of apps all sharing the same basic engine, but with a variety of topical themes.

The currently available games are:

- [Splat-O-Matic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ja2.splatomatic)
- [Shake-A-Boris](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ja2.shakeaboris)

Splat-O-Matic apps are a fun, up-to-date take on the concept of Whac-A-Mole arcade style game. Features across the family include:

- NO IN APP PURCHASES: EVER!
- Fun music tracks and sound effects
- Progressive, Challenging, Never Ending game play
- Daily and All-Time high score lists
- Career mode
- Junior mode – more gently paced for the kids

You can get the Splat-O-Matic family on your Android smart phone from the [JA2 page on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=JA2+Technologies+Ltd).

Coming soon, we’re working on more topically-themed versions of Splat-O-Matic, so you’ll be able to splat a range of famous people without the trouble of police charges! We’re also adding more features across the family.
