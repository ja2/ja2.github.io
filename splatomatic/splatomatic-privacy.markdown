# Splat-O-Matic App Family - Privacy Policy

## What data do we collect?

The Splat-O-Matic family of apps collect data required to support the high score list features.

Additionally, where apps include ads, they use the Google Admob engine to do so. Google’s privacy policy is available here. These apps include the standard Google GDPR consent form to allow full control of your data.

### We collect:
- The alias entered in the app Settings panel – we prefer you not to use your real name for this, or any alias that connects you to other accounts/activities online.
- The player id you can find in the app Settings panel
- Your score
- Which level you got to
- Which app of the Splat-O-Matic family you’re playing.
- Nothing else…

### What don’t we collect?
- The time you played
- How often you play
- Where you played
- Anything that specifically identifies/tracks your device
- Contacts/Address book details
- What you had for breakfast.
- What the weather is like
- How you slept last night
- …you get the idea!

### A specific note on the Player Id:
We would rather not need a player id, but in order to be able to delete your data on demand and satisfy privacy legislation, we have to be able to find it – oh the irony! We don’t use the alias for this as it is publicly visible, which could lead to mischief. See below on how to request a data deletion.

## How long do we keep the data?
Data is kept only for as long as required for the high score list:

The daily high score list is kept up-to 7 days, to allow for previous day’s scores to be viewed.
If you’re amazing, and get on the all time list, then the data will be kept for as long as it takes for you to be knocked off the all time list.
In addition we keep a daily and weekly backup of the data on the server. Therefore your data maybe retained for up to a week in addition to the above times.

## Data deletion request:
To request deletion of your data, email data [at] ja2.co.uk with the following subject “Splatomatic Data – {Player Id}” (replacing “{Player Id}” with the player id value from the app Settings Panel).

When we receive this request we will remove the alias and player id from all active high score table data. These details will be removed from backups around within the following 14 days.

Note that if you clear your apps local storage, this will reset your player id. If this is done it won’t be possible to identify your previous player id, and it won’t be possible to remove that data. (Remember it’ll be gone in a short time frame anyway unless you’re in the all time top 10.)
