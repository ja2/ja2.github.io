## Update: 25-Sep-2020 @ 20:15 UTC - Fill resize bug

Verion 1.11 has now been published to the Roku store with a fix for the issue introduced into version 1.10. If you used the workaround, then once your installation of the Fotum app has upgraded Fill resize mode can be re-selected

Version 1.10 has introduced an issue where the screensaver fails to start if the Fill resize mode is being used. A fix is being investigated. As a workaround in the meantime, please select one of the other resize modes.

## Update: 04-Aug-2020 @ 21:35 UTC – Google Photos in Fotum

Version 1.9 is released and has been in use for over 24 hours. Traffic levels to Google Photos API have now returned to normal levels – far below the daily quota. This looks to have resolved the issue.

After a couple of iterations, a further fix has been developed. The focus this time is on empty Google Photos albums.

Version 1.9 is submitted to Roku for release. This is scheduled for the 5pm release slot on Monday 3rd August.

Once released there will be a further period of around 24 – 36hrs for clients to update before the issue will be fully resolved, if this fix is effective.

## Update: 21-Jul-2020 @ 21:00 UTC – Google Photo in Fotum

The new version, 1.7, is released. Due to the nature of the issue it make take a little time for the issue to be resolved as users pick up the update. Roku’s own documentation states that this should happen over the next 24-36hrs. It’ll become clear over that time whether the fix has been effective.

## Update: 18-Jul-2020 @ 14:48 UTC – Google Photos in Fotum

A fix has been developed and submitted to Roku for review. This is scheduled for release at 17:00 UTC on 21-Jul-2020, subject to successful review.

## Update: 18-Jul-2020 @ 11:05 UTC – Google Photos in Fotum

There is currently an issue with accessing Google Photos from the Fotum screensaver app. You may see an error 429 message when the screensaver starts.

This is due to an issue with a Google Photos Library daily quota being exceeded – This quota applies as a total number of requests across all Fotum Google Photos users. This may be due to single user placing a very large photo collection into the Fotum album in Google Photos (estimated at 10,000s of images).

An update to the Fotum app is being developed to mitigate this. Updates will follow as this progresses. In the meantime the options to use Dropbox or USB (if available on your device) should be unaffected by the issue.
