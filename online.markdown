# Online

I have a varied online presence, with a blog site, plus contributions to online communities and open source projects.

## jonegerton.com

[jonegerton.com](https://jonegerton.com) is my personal development and tinkering blog. Here I cover development issues that I’ve faced that seemed to not be so widely covered online, extended background to answers posted on stackoverflow.com, and other articles around things I’ve been up to.

## StackOverflow

StackOverflow is a fantastic resource for developers, and I’ve solved many problems based on answers or hints from the sight. It’s very rewarding, and important, to be able to give something back to the community and help others. To date I’ve answered over 600 questions as well as assisting with flagging, reviewing and so on. As a measure of these contributions I’m proud to have reached a reputation level of over 30k so far.
